Finance-BankVal-International-GetABA version 0.02
=================================================

This module handles all of the restful web service calls to Unified Software's
BankValInternational ABA validation service. It also handles fail over to the back up services
transparently to the calling script. It can be called in a procedural or OO fashion
(see synopsis)

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

or just copy the .pm file to your PERL lib and ensure you have all the dependencies listed below

The exportable method &getABA(); takes a number of parameters including;

1: Format 	- the response format (either xml, json or csv)

2: ABA		- the ABA routing code to be validated

3: UserID	- available from www.unifiedsoftware.co.uk

4: PIN		- available from www.unifiedsoftware.co.uk

(UserID and PIN are available from http://www.unifiedsoftware.co.uk/freetrial/free-trial-home.html)

The order of the parameters MUST be as above. The UserID and PIN can be stored in the InternationalLoginConfig.txt
file bundled with this module, the use of this file saves passing the PIN and user ID data with each call to getABA.
For example, a call to validate an ABA code passing the user ID and PIN as parameters
and printing the reply to console should follow this form:

=====================================================================

 #!/usr/bin/perl

 use Finance::BankVal::International::GetABA qw(&getABA);

 my $ans = ibanValidate('XML','ABAcode','xmpl123','12345');

 print $ans;

=============================OR for OO===============================

 use Finance::BankVal::International::GetABA;

 $abaObj = Finance::BankVal::International::GetABA->new();
 my $ans = $abaObj->getABA('format','ABA','xmpl123','12345');

 print $ans;

=====================================================================

valid parameter lists are:-

ibanValidate('$format','$aba','$userID','$PIN');

ibanValidate('$format','$aba');

n.b. the last parameter list requires that the user ID and PIN are stored
in the InternationalLoginConfig.txt file bundled with this module.

EXPORT

None by default.
&ibanValidate is exported on request i.e. "use Finance::BankVal::International::GetABA qw(&getABA);"
or to use OO just "use Finance::BankVal::International::GetABA;"
